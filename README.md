# OBS TEXT FUZE
Fuze text files and inject the output into a text source.

The Index file directory should be a list of file directorys for the text files you want to merge. Each file on its own line.
EX: 
E:\Test\First\score.txt
E:\Test\open.txt

Use `%I` where I is the number of the file you gave in (1 indexed) in the formating string to define how you want the outputed text to look. 
EX: `%1 - %2 / Song by: %3`
